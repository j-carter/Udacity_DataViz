# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Data Visualization Final Project


###Summary

My visualization shows the trend in fouls per game and fouls per card given over the past ten seasons in the big four European soccer leagues.  The intent is to show how the game appears to be refereed differently today.  There are fewer fouls called per game and the fouls that are called are more likely to produce a card (either yellow or red).

###Design

I decided to use two line charts to clearly show the trends over time.  I colored the lines to closely match colors used by the national teams for the four countries to make it easier to visually match countries with lines.  Because there are two very similar charts I cut down on some redundancy by using one legend for both charts in the top right.  I also only labeled the bottom x axis since both charts have the same x axis ticks.

After gathering some feedback I decided to zoom in slightly on the y axis rather than having it start at 0.  The slight zoom in makes the downward trend more visible.  I did not zoom in so much though as to potentially make it misleading.

I also softened the colors a bit after my first draft.  I initially started with "red", "blue", etc.  I chose a slightly softer red, blue, etc. to make the colors a little easier on the eyes.

###Feedback

Feedback will be populated in this section.
